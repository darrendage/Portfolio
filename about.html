        <!-- Introduction --> 
        <h1>Where It Started</h1>
        <p>I have always had a passion for creating. As a young boy, I was obsessed with drawing, coloring, building models, painting, and producing radio shows on my tape recorder. </p>
        <p>My first college major was major was broadcasting with the intention of being in front of the camera. But after getting my hands into production, I became fascinated in the behind-the-scenes work of editing and graphics.</p>
        <p>When the internet came around back in the 90's, I discovered the tremendous opportunity to express my creative passion through endless channels. It only fueled my creative passion further by being able to create websites and various multimedia.</p>
        <h1>What I'm Doing</h1>
        <p>Today, I specialize in designing, developing and deploying e-learning multimedia solutions. </p>

        <p>After a thorough consultation with a subject matter expert and developing a plan, I take a vision and translate it into an immersive multimedia experience that enables the user to learn in innovative ways through interactivity, video, animation, and sound. The result is dramatically higher retention levels for the user.</p>
